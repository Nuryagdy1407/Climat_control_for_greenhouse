# Climat_control_for_greenhouse
Controlling the climat in the Greenhouse with Arduino UNO

Requirements:
1. Arduino UNO
2. DHT (Humidity, Temperature) sensor
3. Siol moisture sensor
4. wires and cables
5. a computer with windows OS
6. Knowledge in Electronics (how to connect and make the Arduino code work)
.NET framework 4.5 of course

How to UPLOAD the code to ARDUINO:
1) Open the "Arduino IDE" file in "teplisa Arduino" with Notepad
2) Copy the code
3) Paste it in new Arduino Sketch
4) install the DHT-sensor-library to arduino
5) Verify the code
6) If everything is allright, then UPLOAD it to arduino!
7) Done!

How to run app:
1. Install the setup file
2. Check if the Arduino UNO working correctly (you can see it arduino's console)
3. Just run the app!
